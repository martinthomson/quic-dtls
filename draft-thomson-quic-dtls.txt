1.  Introduction

   QUIC [I-D.tsvwg-quic-protocol] provides a multiplexed transport for
   HTTP [RFC7230] semantics that provides several key advantages over
   HTTP/1.1 [RFC7230] or HTTP/2 [RFC7540] over TCP [RFC0793].

   The custom security protocol designed for QUIC provides critical
   latency improvements for connection establishment.  Absent packet
   loss, most new connections can be established with a single round
   trip; on subsequent connections between the same client and server,
   the client can often send application data immediately, that is, zero
   round trip setup.  DTLS 1.3 uses a similar design and aims to provide
   the same set of improvements.

   This document describes how the standardized DTLS 1.3 might serve as
   a security layer for QUIC.  The same design could work for DTLS 1.2,
   though few of the benefits QUIC provides would be realized due to the
   handshake latency in versions of TLS prior to 1.3.

   Alternative Designs:  There are other designs that are possible; and
      many of these alternative designs are likely to be equally good.
      The point of this document is to articulate a coherent single
      design.  Notes like this throughout the document are used describe
      points where alternatives were considered.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" are used in this
   document.  It's not shouting; when they are capitalized, they have
   the special meaning defined in [RFC2119].

2.  Protocol Overview

   QUIC [I-D.tsvwg-quic-protocol] can be separated into several modules:

   1.  The basic frame envelope describes the common packet layout.
       This layer includes connection identification, version
       negotiation, and includes the indicators that allow the framing,
       public reset, and FEC modules to be identified.

   2.  The public reset is an unprotected frame that allows an
       intermediary (an entity that is not part of the security context)
       to request the termination of a QUIC connection.

   3.  The forward error correction (FEC) module provides redundant
       entropy that allows for frames to be repaired in event of loss.

   4.  Framing comprises most of the QUIC protocol.  Framing provides a
       number of different types of frame, each with a specific purpose.
       Framing supports frames for both congestion management and stream
       multiplexing.  Framing additionally provides a liveness testing
       capability (the PING frame).

   5.  Crypto provides confidentiality and integrity protection for
       frames.  All frames are protected after the handshake completes
       on stream 1.

   6.  Multiplexed streams are the primary payload of QUIC.  These
       provide reliable, in-order delivery of data and are used to carry
       the encryption handshake (stream 1), HTTP header fields (stream
       3), and HTTP requests and responses.  Frames for managing
       multiplexing include those for creating and destroying streams as
       well as flow control and priority frames.

   7.  Congestion management includes packet acknowledgment and other
       signal required to ensure effective use of available link
       capacity.

   8.  HTTP mapping provides an adaptation to HTTP that is based on
       HTTP/2.

   The relative relationship of these components are pictorally
   represented in Figure 1.

   This document describes a replacement of the cryptographic parts of
   QUIC.  This includes the handshake messages that are exchanged on
   stream 1, plus the record protection that is used to encrypt and
   authenticate all other frames.

2.1.  Handshake Overview

   TLS 1.3 provides two basic handshake modes of interest to QUIC:

   o  A full handshake in which the client is able to send application
      data after one round trip and the server immediately after
      receiving the first message from the client.

   o  A 0-RTT handshake in which the client uses information about the
      server to send immediately.  This data can be replayed by an
      attacker so it MUST NOT carry a self-contained trigger for any
      non-idempotent action.

   A simplified TLS 1.3 handshake with 0-RTT application data is shown
   in Figure 2, see [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] for more options.

      [Application Data]        <------->      [Application Data]

                    Figure 2: TLS Handshake with 0-RTT

   Two additional variations on this basic handshake exchange are
   relevant to this document:

   o  The server can respond to a ClientHello with a HelloRetryRequest,
      which adds an additional round trip prior to the basic exchange.
      This is needed if the server wishes to request a different key
      exchange key from the client.  HelloRetryRequest might also be
      used to verify that the client is correctly able to receive
      packets on the address it claims to have (see Section 4.1.1).

   o  A pre-shared key mode can be used for subsequent handshakes to
      avoid public key operations.  (FFS: 0-RTT for PSK seems feasible,
      but it isn't clearly defined right now).

3.  QUIC over DTLS Structure

   QUIC completes its cryptographic handshake on stream 1, which means
   that the negotiation of keying material happens within the QUIC
   protocol.  In contrast, QUIC over DTLS uses a layered approach, where
   QUIC frames are exchanged as DTLS application data.

      +---------------------------------+

                         Figure 3: QUIC over DTLS

   In this design QUIC frames are exchanged as DTLS application data.
   FEC and public reset are provided as minimal protocols that are
   multiplexed with DTLS, using a different value for the first octet of
   the UDP payload (see Section 5.2 for a sample design).

   The DTLS handshake is the first data that is exchanged on a
   connection, though additional QUIC-specific data might be included,
   see Section 4.1.

   Alternative Design:  DTLS could be used as a drop-in replacement for
      the handshake protocol used by QUIC crypto.  This would require
      less restructuring of QUIC.  However, that suggests that record
      protection is ultimately managed by QUIC, negating much of the
      advantage provided by choosing a layered design.  For instance,
      improvements are made to DTLS would not be immediately available
      to QUIC.  A more serious problem here is the synchronization of
      frames with the traffic keys used to protect them.  Within DTLS,
      the transition from cleartext to handshake traffic keys and
      application traffic keys is carefully synchronized with the
      handshake.  Coordinating multiple key derivations for use in a
      drop-in design would require careful synchronization.

4.  Mapping of QUIC to QUIC over DTLS

   Several changes to the structure of QUIC are necessary to make a
   layered design practical.

   These changes produce the handshake shown in Figure 4, where QUIC
   frames are exchanged as DTLS application data.

                    Figure 4: QUIC over DTLS Handshake

   The remainder of this section describes how QUIC features are
   modified to fit into a layered design.

4.1.  Handshake Additions

   [I-D.tsvwg-quic-protocol] does not describe any connection-level
   state that might be included by a client in a standard 1-RTT
   handshake to aid in connection setup.  However, the following
   additions are either implemented, or might be.

4.1.1.  Source Address Validation

   QUIC implementations describe a source address token.  This is an
   opaque blob that a server provides to clients when they first use a
   given source address.  The client returns this token in subsequent
   messages as a return routeability check.  That is, the client returns
   this token to prove that it is able to receive packets at the source
   address that it claims.

   Since this token is opaque and consumed only by the server, it can be
   included in the TLS 1.3 configuration identifier for 0-RTT
   handshakes.  Servers that use 0-RTT are advised to provide new
   configuration identifiers after every handshake to avoid passive
   linkability of connections from the same client.

Internet-Draft               QUIC over DTLS                 January 2016


   A server that is under load might include the same information in the
   cookie extension/field of a HelloRetryRequest.  (Note: the current
   version of TLS 1.3 does not include this information.)

4.1.2.  Transport Parameter Advertisement

   A client describes characteristics of the transport protocol it
   intends to conduct with the server in a new
   "quic_transport_parameters" extension in its ClientHello.  The server
   uses this information to determine whether it wants to continue the
   connection, request source address validation, or reject the
   connection.  Having this information unencrypted permits this check
   to occur prior to committing the resources needed to complete the
   initial key exchange.

   If the server decides to complete the connection, it generates a
   corresponding response and includes it in the EncryptedExtensions
   message.

   These parameters are not confidentiality-protected when sent by the
   client, but the server response is protected by the handshake traffic
   keys.  The entire exchange is integrity protected once the handshake
   completes.

   This information is not used by DTLS, but passed to the QUIC protocol
   as initialization parmeters.

4.1.3.  Congestion Management Before Handshake Completion

   In addition to the parameters for the transport, congestion feedback
   might need be exchanged prior to completing a key exchange is
   complete.

   A new QUIC congestion extension might be included by clients to
   include any information.  Servers might include this extension if
   there is a need to use the HelloRetryRequest also.  Once the
   handshake is complete, this information can be exchanged as QUIC
   frames.

   The use of extensions for the purpose has some potential drawbacks:

   o  Extensions are vulnerable to modification prior to the successful
      completion of the handshake.  (The key schedule is structured so
      that the handshake encryption keys will likely differ if
      extensions are modified, though this is not a strong guarantee.)

   o  Extensions are authenticated, and therefore cannot contain updated
      information if they need to be retransmitted.

Internet-Draft               QUIC over DTLS                 January 2016


   o  Extensions that appear prior to the EncryptedExtensions do not
      have any confidentiality protection.

   Section 5.1 identifies the related issue of loss feedback mechanisms
   during the handshaking phase.

4.2.  Record Protection

   No changes are required to transport frames as DTLS application data.

4.3.  Protocol and Version Negotiation

   Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) [RFC7301] will be used
   to negotiate the version of QUIC that is used.  This is a more
   verbose mechanism than the scheme used in QUIC, but it is also more
   capable.  For example, specific QUIC versions could be separately
   identified: "quic-draft-01", "quic-draft-02", and "quic-underdamped-
   cc".

4.4.  Connection ID

   The connection identifier serves to identify a connection and to
   allow a server to resume an existing connection from a new client
   address in case of mobility events.

   TLS 1.3 offers connection resumption using pre-shared keys, which
   might permit a client to send 0-RTT application data (Note: this is
   an open issue in TLS).  This mode could be used to continue a
   connection rather than rely on a publicly visible correlator.

   Alternatively, clients could use a new 0-RTT handshake to continue
   existing connections.

4.5.  Entropy Bit

   This can be removed, and is (apparently) already have been removed
   from current implementations.

4.6.  Forward Error Control (FEC)

   FEC can be covered by encryption and forms part of the framing layer.
   The current protocol has some external parts, but these can be
   encrypted.

Internet-Draft               QUIC over DTLS                 January 2016


4.7.  Sequence Numbers

   QUIC relies on a single sequence number space for identifying frames.
   DTLS does not provide a contiguous sequence number space as each
   change of traffic keys causes sequence numbers to be reset.  This
   change occurs at the transition from 0-RTT application data to full
   application data, plus when traffic keys are updated.

   DTLS sequence numbers could be used in QUIC acknowledgments, but some
   modification would be needed to allow for the epoch change and
   sequence number resets.

   A possible design has separate acknowledgment frames for different
   epochs.  Reserving a small number of bits (a little as 1 or 2 bits
   would suffice) for identifying the epoch in longer sequence number
   representations would allow each acknowledgment frame be limited to
   that epoch.  Shorter representations might omit the epoch bits so
   that normal operation can identify a wider range of packets without
   inflating packet size inordinately.

   The consequence of this design is that there will be multiple
   acknowledgment frames sent for a short period after an epoch change.
   A modification to QUIC's STOP_WAITING frame might be used to quickly
   end any need for acknowledgment on the expired epoch.

   Editor's Note:  The design of STOP_WAITING relies on the sequence
      number of the packet that it is contained in.  That design doesn't
      work in this case.  Adding a single octet that included the
      affected epoch would also allow the packet to be self-contained
      and include a the sequence number length.

   There is no need to explicitly signal the sequence number of the last
   packet in an epoch.  The last sequence number for the epoch will be
   included in an acknowledgment.

   Alternative Design:  A separate sequence number space could be added
      to the DTLS-protected QUIC frames, inside the protected DTLS
      record.  This is potentially redundant, but it ensures that QUIC
      is more independent of DTLS.

5.  Modifications to DTLS

   DTLS 1.3 does not need substantial modifications in order to support
   the more critical features of QUIC.  However, some additional changes
   might be made to optimize DTLS for use with QUIC.

   Since the work on TLS 1.3 is not yet complete, these changes might be
   integrated before TLS 1.3 is completed.  Failing that, new extensions
   to TLS might be considered to negotiate their use.

5.1.  Handshake Message Loss Recovery

   DTLS has a somewhat simplistic retransmission scheme for its
   handshake datagrams.  An entire flight of handshake messages is sent
   repeatedly by an endpoint until it receives a response from its peer.
   In this regard, the QUIC scheme of acknowledgments is more precise in
   identifying and repairing missing datagrams.  Providing a more
   complete and accurate feedback mechanism would be valuable in
   reducing the performance of the handshake.

5.2.  DTLS Datagram Header

   DTLS 1.2 [RFC6347] has a rather large per-packet overhead.  This
   overhead includes a content type (1 octet), protocol version (2
   octets), an epoch (2 octets), sequence number (6 octets) and length
   (2 octets), totalling 13 octets on every record.  Of these, only the
   sequence number and 14 bits of the record length are critical to the
   correct functioning of the protocol and both might be reduced in
   size.  A single bit of the epoch is useful in allowing an endpoint to
   more easily identify when keys change.

   Note that a change to the packet format needs to be carefully
   designed if DTLS is to remain compatible with existing use cases.
   DTLS-SRTP [RFC5764] relies on the value of the first octet of the
   DTLS packet not overlapping with valid values for SRTP [RFC3711] and
   STUN [RFC5389].  Only values 20 through 63 inclusive are guaranteed
   to be available to DTLS in that context.

   One possible design has a four octet header, comprising three fixed
   bits (001), 1 epoch bit, 12 sequence number bits, 2 zero bits, and 14
   length bits.  This format would only apply to encrypted datagrams,
   since the ClientHello and ServerHello would need to be backward
   compatible.

   Note that the second set of zero bits could be used for an expanded
   sequence number space.  However, if there is any expectation of being
   able to use datagrams that are more than 4096 packets out of

   sequence, then adding another octet might be a better option, even if
   that results in destroying word alignment.

   This design allows for unprotected messages such as unprotected
   handshake messages and the QUIC public reset to use values between 20
   and 31 in the first octet.  If FEC is used to repair protected
   packets (a detail that [I-D.tsvwg-quic-protocol] is unclear on), then
   FEC packets can use a first octet in this range as well.

   Alternative Design:  If a UDP datagram is restricted to containing a
      single DTLS record, the length field could be omitted entirely,
      reducing the unencrypted overhead to as little as 2 octets.  The
      drawback of this approach is that it could require some additional
      UDP datagrams during the handshake, since changes to keying
      material can only happen when a new record is sent.

6.  Security Considerations

   Including data outside of the DTLS protection layer exposes endpoints
   to all sorts of intermediary-initiated shenanigans.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
